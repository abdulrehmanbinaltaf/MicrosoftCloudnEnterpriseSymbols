## What
![A set of symbols/icons to visually represent features of and systems that use Microsoft Azure and related technologies.](https://mountainss.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/enterprise-cloud-visio-icons.png)

This is the official symbol set for both the Azure User Experience (UX) and the Microsoft Content Services & International (CSI) group. The UX group creates the look and feel for www.microsoft.com/azure  and the Azure Management Portals.  The CSI group maintains most of the official Azure technical documentation on MSDN and the azure.microsoft.com web site. Many symbols are used in the Azure Infographics and Microsoft Architecture Blueprints.   
The symbol set includes not only those for Azure, but also on-premises products like Windows Server and SQL Server. 

## Why
Using these symbols to describe systems built with Azure and other Microsoft products helps establish a consistent visual language. This speeds the understanding of system scenarios and architectures and anchors discussions among Microsoft employees, customers, and other 3rd parties.  

## Use
where and when Use the symbols in architectural diagrams, training decks or your own documentation as appropriate.  Also download the New Office Visio Stencil which contains over 300 useful symbols and icons. When there is a conflict between the sets, use the symbols in the Cloud and Enterprise set over those in other sets.
